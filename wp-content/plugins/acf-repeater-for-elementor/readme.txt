== Description ==

This plugin helps you repeat elementor elements/widgets/sections easy and simple as possible.
To use this plugin you will need elementor, elementor pro and ACF pro.


== Usage ==

First set the class of the widget you would like to repeat, could be column/inner section/single widget like so: "repeater_{name_of_the_repeater}".
{name_of_the_repeater} is need to be replaced with the name of the repeater that you set using ACF Pro.
Now anywhere inside that widget/element you can set the parameters you would like to inject, like so: #name
"name" should be replaced by you to any field you set for the repeater.
#name will be replaced when render the widget with the value of the row you set in the post.

For using toggle/accordion you should create a repeater with two fields (type text or Wysiwyg Editor) and set id of the title as tab_title and the content as tab_content.

== Important==
Currently this plugin support only text/urls/accordion&toggle tabs.
Tested on elementor native elements only.
